32,2019/05/29 8:03:34 PM GMT+2,18,"Yes I study Japanese using ""Remembering the kanji"" methodology from Heising. It basically consists in creating stories associating meaning and the writing of the word. It's really important to get an emotional attachment to the story. For example for the word ""movie"" I remember it ends with ""kuva"" which means figure (I learnt that one while reading previously) . So I imagined watching a very boring movie with figures. Or January ends with ""kuu"" and this reminded me of a baby born in January (it makes sense for me somehow) so I just see that part of the word and recognize it but I don't remember the word fully. The word for version has 3 ä, dots like in versioning for software. The word for claim has the same 3 ä but they are evenly spaced so I imagined someone complaining periodically over time. I have a trick for all words in the database and after 5 minutes I could recall all of them (I didn't use 12 minutes).",y,,y,y,,y,No it's the first time I learn like this.
