1,2019/06/05 6:11:25 PM GMT+2,36,Yes. Strategies like memorizing vocabulary using mnemonics and relating words with pictures,y,36
2,2019/06/05 6:11:47 PM GMT+2,5,"yes. I associated some words with english, or other languages I already knew (by removing letters or changing its shape in general) and it was easier to remember",y,5

5,2019/06/05 6:15:41 PM GMT+2,25,"Yes, I could remember some of the imagery i had created during the previous session. In particular the little girl on the island, the bear which is a car (karhu), the lake source (lakesoosa), the rainy collar (rainikohla).
Some of the sound-based techniques also worked, such as 'maahkunta' ~= 'my country' ie. province
But a lot of the words i simply couldn't remember",y,25

8,2019/06/05 6:19:05 PM GMT+2,17,"I tried to memorize them by making funny associations, some of them I remembered, but honestly very often I was confused by similar looking words, and it is possible I assigned two different terms to the same word. ",y,17
9,2019/06/05 6:19:20 PM GMT+2,23,"yes, when I saw certain words, I immediately remembered the play on words I had memorized for said word. However, I didn't recognize most of the words in the test, which was problematic. ",y,23

11,2019/06/05 6:19:21 PM GMT+2,4,"A little, by remembering words similar to the finnish word in question
Ex: ""saarella""(or however it is spelled) ~= ""Sarella"", Game of Thrones character 
=> Memorize: ""Game of thrones"" <=> Island",y,
12,2019/06/05 6:20:09 PM GMT+2,33,"Some of them did. Mnemonics, like ""municipality"" that sounds close to ""county"", ""single"" that sounds close to Slavic ""odyn/jeden"", the fact that the names of the month have a specific ending, I could somehow see the word ""success"" in the Finnish word for ""order""",y,33
13,2019/06/05 6:20:32 PM GMT+2,31,"some helped. By making a ""phrase"" of the translation and the finnish word. Toi (something): working (work) with toys. Liike: I like movement",y,
14,2019/06/05 6:20:46 PM GMT+2,19,i did not use any specific strategy.,n,19
15,2019/06/05 6:21:51 PM GMT+2,1,"I remembered word 'river' by thinking of a girl's name 'joen'. It was also helpful to think about how words look, which is how I remembered words 'home' and 'base' e.g.",y,1
16,2019/06/05 6:22:49 PM GMT+2,28,"Yes, I remembered the suffix for the months",y,
17,2019/06/05 6:22:57 PM GMT+2,26,"Yes. I remembered 'tunnista' because I linked ""tunn"" with tuna -> tunas have eyes on the side of their bodies -> they have trouble *recognizing* things. I also made a (wrong after having tought about it) link between the 'l' of 'luvun' and the roman numeral 50 (which I wrongly thought was hundred -> century).",y,26
18,2019/06/05 6:23:08 PM GMT+2,12,"A little, the few words similar to English I could pick out but other than that I feel I only remembered some of the words learnt through repetition (kuva, tulevat, kunta).",y,12
19,2019/06/05 6:23:30 PM GMT+2,37,"Not really, I just had a vague recollection of words, but I didn't remember their meanings. And it was way easier in the fill-in-the-blanks type of questions just like last time.",n,37
20,2019/06/05 6:23:40 PM GMT+2,14,"I barely remembered the words and the meanings. So, the strategies didn't seem to be helpful  ",n,14
22,2019/06/05 6:26:03 PM GMT+2,22,"Yes, I remember laaksossa was valley because I associated it with ""lake sosa"", a combination of two english words I already knew. Some others were easy to remember because they were very short, like joen for river. Other words like ""home"" I remembered because the word always started with a capital K, and the word for majority I remembered because it was in two different words.",y,22
23,2019/06/05 6:26:10 PM GMT+2,27,"Yes, making some conections between english and finish. For example: tieden as science (because of the -ie in both of them).
